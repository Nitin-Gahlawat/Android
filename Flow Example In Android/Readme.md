# Kotlin Flow Example in Android

This project demonstrates the usage of `Flow` in Kotlin for managing asynchronous data streams in Android applications. The app showcases how to collect data from a flow, handle data updates, and manage UI states reactively.

## Features
- **Flow Basics:** Learn how to create and collect flows.
- **State Management:** Update UI based on flow emissions.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors in flows using `catch`.
- **Concurrency:** Combine flows with `combine` and handle multiple data streams.
