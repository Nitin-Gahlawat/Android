# Android Navigation Graph (NavGraph)

This Android project implements the Navigation Component using NavGraph for seamless navigation between different fragments in an Android app. The Navigation Component simplifies fragment transactions and helps with managing app navigation in a more structured way.

## Features

- **NavGraph**: Uses a `NavHostFragment` to host the navigation graph.
- **Safe Args**: Implements Safe Args to type-safely pass data between fragments.
- **Deep Linking**: Configures deep links for direct navigation to specific destinations within the app.
- **Up and Back Navigation**: Handles up navigation and back stack management automatically.
