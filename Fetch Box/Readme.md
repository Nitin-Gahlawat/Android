# FetchBox Application

## Overview

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates the use of key modern Android libraries and tools: Retrofit, Room Database, RecyclerView, and Dagger Hilt. The app fetches data from a remote server, stores it in a local Room database, and displays the data in a RecyclerView. Dependency injection is handled using Dagger Hilt.

## Features

- **Retrofit**: Used for making network requests and fetching data from a remote server.
- **Room Database**: Stores data locally in the device, enabling offline functionality.
- **RecyclerView**: Displays data in a scrollable list.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Provides dependency injection to manage dependencies in a scalable and modular way.
