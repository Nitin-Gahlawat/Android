# Android Room Database Example (Kotlin)

This project demonstrates how to implement a local database using **Room** in an Android application. Room is part of Android's Architecture Components, and it provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while ensuring a clean API for database operations.

## Features
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Room.
- Simple User Entity with DAO (Data Access Object).
- ViewModel and LiveData for observing changes in data.
- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.
