## Intent

An `Intent` in Android is used to start activities or services. It allows communication between components. For example, you can use an intent to navigate from one activity to another.

## WebView

A `WebView` is a view that allows you to display web pages inside your Android app. You can use it to load URLs and render web content within your application.

## Date and Time

Android provides `DatePickerDialog` and `TimePickerDialog` to allow users to select a date and time from a dialog. This is useful for apps that require the user to input specific date or time values.

## Toast

A `Toast` is a simple message that pops up on the screen for a short period of time. It's used to show brief notifications or feedback to the user.

## RadioButton

`RadioButton` is used in conjunction with `RadioGroup` to allow the user to select one option from a set of choices. It is commonly used in forms or selection interfaces where only one option can be chosen at a time.

## Basic View

A `Basic View` typically refers to the basic UI elements like `TextView`, `Button`, `ImageView`, etc., that make up an Android app's interface. These elements are added to layouts and used to interact with the user.

## Switch

A `Switch` is a widget that allows the user to toggle between two states (ON/OFF). It is commonly used for settings or preferences in Android apps.
