# Retrofit API Fetching Example

This repository demonstrates how to fetch data from a REST API using Retrofit in Android. Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, which makes it easy to connect to a RESTful web service and parse the response.

## Introduction

This project provides an example of how to use Retrofit to make API calls, handle responses, and display the fetched data in an Android application. In this example, we will:

1. Define a `data model` for the response.
2. Create a Retrofit interface with HTTP methods.
3. Set up Retrofit in the app.
4. Fetch data and handle the response.
