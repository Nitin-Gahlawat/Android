# SOLID Principles - Code Examples

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the **SOLID** principles of object-oriented design. SOLID is a set of five design principles that, when followed, can help create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software systems. The principles are:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
