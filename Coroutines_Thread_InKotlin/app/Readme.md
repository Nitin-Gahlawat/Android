# Kotlin Threading and Coroutines Showcase

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of **Threads** and **Coroutines** in Kotlin for handling concurrent tasks and asynchronous operations. You will find examples of both techniques to understand how they differ, how to manage threads in a multi-threaded environment, and how Kotlin's Coroutines simplify asynchronous programming.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Threading** in Kotlin using the `Thread` class
- **Coroutines** in Kotlin using `launch`, `async`,`Child Coroutines` and other coroutine builders
- Comparison of Threading vs Coroutines for concurrency
- Managing background tasks and handling synchronization

## Features

- **Thread Example:** A basic use case that demonstrates how to create and start new threads to perform background tasks.
- **Coroutine Example:** A demonstration of how to perform the same background tasks using Kotlin's Coroutines, showcasing how coroutines are lightweight and more efficient than threads.
- **Comparison of Threads and Coroutines:** Side-by-side examples to compare the performance and ease of use.
